	"Forced Draft": {
		title: "Boiler Industry Forced Draft Fans",
		intro:
			"Fans that are used to pressurize a space or create mechanical air pressure in a system are referred to as forced draft fans. Occasionally, manufacturing spaces are required by specifications to be maintained at a specific positive pressure. This requirement is common in clean room processes for scientific work. Forced draft is also used to identify the combustion process used in large boilers. When mechanical ventilation is supplied to these boilers, the heat transfer rate increases; the boiler can be reduced in size to produce the same amount of energy as natural draft.",
